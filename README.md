# safe-search-hosts
This script fetches the latest list of google domains and generates a hosts file
that can be used to force safe search for your entire computer, or router.

- On computers running Linux/BSD, look in: /etc/hosts
- On computers running Microsoft Windows, look in: C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts

# hosts
The hosts file contains the results of that script for easy implementation, along with similar manually compiled results for several other major search engines. The list currently includes Bing, Brave (broken), DuckDuckGo, Google, Yahoo (blocked), and Yandex.
